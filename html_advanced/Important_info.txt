The scope attribute in HTML is used with <th> (table header) elements to specify which cells the header cell applies to. It helps provide context to the data inside a table and improves accessibility by helping screen readers interpret the table correctly.

The scope attribute can have one of the following values:

col: The header cell provides header information for the rest of the column it is in.
row: The header cell provides header information for the rest of the row it is in.
colgroup: The header cell provides header information for the rest of the column group it is in.
rowgroup: The header cell provides header information for the rest of the row group it is in.
